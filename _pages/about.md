Updated August 2025

I'm a PhD Candidate at Washington University in St. Louis, working with [Randall Martin](https://engineering.washu.edu/faculty/Randall-Martin.html) in the [Atmospheric Composition Analysis Group (ACAG)](https://sites.wustl.edu/acag/). My research focuses on the characterization and evaluation of carbonaceous aerosol using a globally distributed network [SPARTAN](https://www.spartan-network.org/) and a chemical transport model [GEOS-Chem](https://geoschem.github.io/index.html).

Before joining ACAG, I received an M.S. in Environmental Science from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/)(Beijing, China) and a B.E. in Environmental Engineering from [Shandong University](https://www.en.sdu.edu.cn/)(Jinan, China). My master's research, advised by [Hefa Cheng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2a9AIHkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), focused on airborne heavy metal characterization, source apportionment, and health risk assessment.
